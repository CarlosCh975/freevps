A server with root access is the perfect choice for your project, provided you have the technical expertise and the necessary time. Although managed solutions ease the workload, they do place excessive restrictions on your flexibility, especially in more complex projects. A VPS Server or vServer lets you enjoy the benefits of a root server at a very favorable price: install Apache, MySQL, PHP, or others; use FTP to upload your CMS software to the server, for instance WordPress or Drupal, and then install it yourself. Write your own applications and run them on your web server. If you like, you can also install a mail server with more options than the preinstalled program. A VPS Server is a virtualized server that shares the storage space of a single hard drive with other VPS. This is one of the reasons why VPS are available at such affordable prices. <p><a href="https://gratisvps.net">Free VPS Server</a></p>
